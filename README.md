# Pneumonia-detection-using-CNN
This project focuses on detecting pneumonia using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on chest X-ray images. Our team applied data augmentation to handle imbalanced datasets and improve model accuracy. The project enhanced our understanding of deep learning, image classification, and AI in medical diagnostics.
